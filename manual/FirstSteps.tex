\section{First Steps}

\lib requires CMake and a C++11-compatible compiler.

To get and compile the sources on UNIX-like systems, type the following in a terminal:

\begin{verbatim}
git clone https://github.com/actor-framework/actor-framework
cd actor-framework
./configure
make
make install [as root, optional]
\end{verbatim}

We recommended to run the unit tests as well:

\begin{verbatim}
make test
\end{verbatim}

If the output indicates an error, please submit a bug report that includes (a) your compiler version, (b) your OS, and (c) the content of the file \texttt{build/Testing/Temporary/LastTest.log}.
